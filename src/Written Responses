A3Q1: Binary Search.

23, 27, 30, 34, 41, 51, 55, 57, 60, 67, 72, 78, 83, 96

Start by checking the middle number 55, since the number 41 is less than 55, the number 55
itself as well as the top half of the  numbers can be eliminated.

23, 27, 30, 34, 41, 51

Again it will check the middle number and in this case it would be 30, since 41 is higher than 30
the number 30 itself as well as the top half of the numbers can be eliminated.

34, 41, 51

It will check the middle once more and it will find the number 41, finishing the sorting and searching.

A3Q1 Continued: Sequential Search 

23, 27, 30, 34, 41, 51, 55, 57, 60, 67, 72, 78, 83, 96

Start by checking the first number. In this case it would be 23. It will check 23 and confirm that it
is not 41 so it would eliminate the number and move on.

27, 30, 34, 41, 51, 55, 57, 60, 67, 72, 78, 83, 96  

It will do the same thing again, check the number and this case it is 27. 27 is not 41 so it would
eliminate it and move on to the next number.

30, 34, 41, 51, 55, 57, 60, 67, 72, 78, 83, 96  

Once again it will do the same thing. Check the number and this time it is 30. 30 is not 41 so it will
eliminate it and move on. 

34, 41, 51, 55, 57, 60, 67, 72, 78, 83, 96  

Once again it will do the check and eliminate. In this case it is 34 and 34 is not 41 so it 
will eliminate it and move on. 

41, 51, 55, 57, 60, 67, 72, 78, 83, 96  

It will do the check again. This number is 41 and since it is looking for the number 41 and it has found
it the search has ended. 

A3Q2: Bubble Sort.

25, 30, 20, 80, 40, 60

Start by taking the first two numbers. In this case it is 25 and 30. It will look at the numbers and
see if the digit on the left is smaller than the one on the right. In this this it is the the two
numbers will stay where they are. 

25, 30, 20, 80, 40, 60

It will now look at the second and third numbers. In this case it is 30 and 20. It will notice that 
20 is smaller than 30 so it will swap the positions and move on to the next set of numbers. 

25, 20, 30, 80, 40, 60

It will now look at the third and fourth numbers. This time it is 30 and 80. It will notice that the
two numbers are in ascending order so it will keep the numbers where they are. 

25, 20, 30, 80, 40, 60

Now it will look at the fourth and fifth numbers. In this case it is 80 and 40. It will look at the 
two numbers and notice that 40 is smaller than 80 it will swap the places of the two numbers. 

25, 20, 30, 40, 80, 60

It will do it once last time for this row of numbers. The final numbers are 80 and 60 and it will 
notice that 60 is smaller than 80 so it will swap the places of the two numbers. 

25, 20, 30, 40, 60, 80

It will go through the row of numbers again to see if they are all in the right order. In this case
the two numbers will be 25 and 20. It will notice that 20 is smaller than 25 so it will swap
the places of the two numbers. 

20, 25, 30, 40, 60, 80

It will look at the second and third number this time. It will notice that the two numbers are in 
ascending order so it will have the numbers stay where they are.

20, 25, 30, 40, 60, 80

It will now look at the third and fourth number. It will notice that the number on the left is 
smaller than the number on the right so it will have the numbers stay where they are. 

20, 25, 30, 40, 60, 80

Now it will look at the fourth and fifth number. It will notice that the numbers are in ascending
order so the numbers will stay where they are. 

Finally it will look at the fifth and sixth numbers. It will notice that the numbers are in ascending
order so the numbers will stay where they are. 

20, 25, 30, 40, 60, 80

It will go through the set of numbers one last time to ensure that all the numbers get bigger as
they move to the right.

20, 25, 30, 40, 60, 80 

It will notice that the numbers are in face in ascending order so the sort is now complete. 

A3Q3: Maximum number of comparisons. 

The maximum number of comparisons would be three. This is shown in the example below. 

1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7

1) To start off it would take out the middle number and in this case it is 4. The number that was 
being looked for would then be either in the top half or the bottom half. For this example lets
say the number being looked for was 1. 

1, 2, 3

2) The numbers would again be split up by eliminating a portion of the numbers. It will choose the
middle number in this case it is two. The only number that would be left is 1. 

1

3) It is now left with only one digit. It will do one final search to confirm that one is the 
correct number and since it is, the search has concluded.

A3Q4: Which is faster?

When dealing with large arrays, selection sort would be faster. This is because there is not as 
many moves that have to be made. When doing selection sort you need to go through each number
and figure out if each number is smaller than the one that is already put aside, therefore 
selection sort is faster. 

A3Q5: The best big O value.

The best big O value is O(1), this is because it is the most effective in my opinion.
