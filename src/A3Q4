Question: 

For large arrays, in the worst case, is selection sort faster than insertion sort? Explain.

Answer:

For large arrays that are in the worst case, selection sort and insertion sort will 
preform equally. However given the option of choosing between the two in this case, 
selection sort would be "faster". I believe this because through the code of selection sort
it looks for the smallest (or largest depending on which way you want to sort), 
and places it in the correct position. Then it repeats this process until it has reached 
the end of the numbers to sort. Therefore, selection sort will only have to make
the minimum amount of transitions, placing it in the proper place right away. 
Whereas, insertion sort will sort the array one number at a time. 
It essentially picks up the number and shuffles it down the array until it finds 
the appropriate spot in the array. This means that this type of array will 
constantly swap the numbers making a large amount of transitions to the array, not
always placing it in the right position right away.
